        <p>The Visualizations for this data set is as:</p>
        <div class="img-text-container">
            <p id = "heatmap" ><img src="heatmap.jpg" height = "800px" width = "800px" style="float: left;"><h3>The main goal of this project is to predict interest_rate from this dataset. To do so we will have to find features correlated to the interest_rate column.
                For this we will use the heatmap Visualization. The features with color closer to blue are positively correlated with interest_rate and closer to yellow
                are negatively correlated. From this graph we can say that the columns grade and sub_grade are most positively correlated to the target.</h3>

            <p id = "issue"><img src="issue_month.jpg" height = "800px" width = "800px" style="float: left;"><h3>The issue_month column shows the month and year the loan was issued.
                We can see from this bar graph on the left that the mean interest rate for the month of Feb in year 2018 was slight higher than the two neighbour months i.e Jan and March.

            <p id = "dist"><img src="dist.jpg" height = "800px" width = "800px" style="float: left;"><h3>For better predictions we need to know what kind of distribution the interest_rate 
                column belongs to. From the distribution graph on the left we can say that the distribution has the highest density for interest rates of log 9.93.

        <div class = "img-text-container">
            <p id = "grade"><img src="grade.jpg" height = "800px" width = "800px" style="float: left;"><h3>As the sub_grade and grade columns were the most correlated with the interest_rate column, it makes sense to 
                check their graphs. The sub_grade column has 32 unique values so plotting that would require more time. For now we will use the grade column. The grade column has 7 unique values 
                ranging from A - G with A being the highest grade. When we plot interest_rate vs grade barplot, we can see as the grade goes lower, the interest_rate increases. This contradicts the positive correlation.
                This happens because while encoding the strings with labels we labelled A as 0 and G as 6. So technically A is the highest grade but its label is 0.

        <div class = "img-text-container">
            <p id = "emp_length"><img src="emp_length.jpg" height = "800px" width = "800px" style="float: left;"><h3>The emp_title column had too many unique values so we will consider the emp_length column.
                The emp_length column has been capped at 10 as max_value and anything greater than 10 will be rounded to 10. Thus this column only as 11 unique values, 0 - 10. These 
                values are the number of years an employee has been in the company. We would expect the interest rate to go low as years increase but the graph says otherwise. Although,
                there may be other factors affecting the interest rate like grade and other features, We can check about that in future.
